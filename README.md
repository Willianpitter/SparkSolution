2. Download Netflix dataset
Download Netflix dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data

3. properly configure in code the paths to where the downloaded folders are.
	
If all folders are in the same directory as the notebook and the ones named "netflix_reviews" for netflix data and  "amazon_reviews_us_Digital_Video_Download_v1_00" for Amazon data, the notebook should run without having to change the paths.
